Thanks to re:quest it is now possible to develop your own Escape Games with an individual story. The special feature: re:quest is primarily aimed at educational institutions in order to convey their own educational content in a playful way and to promote digital skills at the same time. This is intended to strengthen digital education at extracurricular learning venues such as museums, libraries and student laboratories. Not only educational institutions, but especially children and young people benefit from re:quests. In addition to exciting adventures and tricky puzzles, various tasks such as data analysis, cryptography, data protection and privacy puzzles, programming or media analysis strengthen the so-called 21st Century Skills."
